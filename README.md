This is a Simple Schedule that can manage your Activity, but Temporarily. I'm sure this useful and becomes handy.  

# How to use it ?  
- So basically you can go to signup.html first, and register your account (randomly), so you can enter the dashboard.  
- After you finish to register your account, you can check it on LocalStorage by simply **right click on mouse** -> inspect or just press F12 on your computer / laptop.  
- If you on mobile, you can check it by press 3 dots on top right on your browser and go to inspect from there.  
- after a popup appear, you can see a list "elements", "console", etc on the top right, then you go press the double side to the right icon (?) and there are bunch of list and that's one that write "Application", go press it.  
- After that you can click **Local Storage**, and you can see that account you register before.
- Go to login.html and use your account to enter it, and finally you can access the dashboard and do whatever you do in there, Good Luck.
